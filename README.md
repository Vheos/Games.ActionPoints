# About
On the surface, it's just another of my countless Unity projects. But look a little deeper and you'll find out it's **THE CHOSEN ONE** - chosen to get publicly released instead of privately shelved ;) So yeah, that's basically it - `ActionPoints` is my first attempt at actual finished product. Wish me luck!
